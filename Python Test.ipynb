    "You are tasked with solving 3 technical problems including data extraction, manipulation and risk calculation and analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend to code Problems 1 and 2 in Jupyter notebook but you are free to use other languages too. \n",
    "\n",
    "For problem 1, please consider the following aspects of your solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maintainability - could someone easily modify/fix your code?\n",
    "* Style - is the code readable and consistent with best coding practices?\n",
    "* Reusability - is the code easy to adapt to solve similar problems?\n",
    "* Documentation - are there meaningful comments in the code? \n",
    "* Modularity - how easy would it be to integrate your script into a carious other processes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Google is your friend - feel free to look things up, but please keep in mind that you will need to explain how you solved the problem and why you did it in this particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please read **note** carefully as they contain important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We will ask you talk us through your code during the next interview, please be prepared to cover the following points:\n",
    "* Summary of problem - For audience who don't know this exercise\n",
    "* How do you structure your solutions to solve the problem (code the solution)?\n",
    "* What difficulties you encountered and how did you overcome it?\n",
    "* If allowing more time, where you could/wanted do it better?"
